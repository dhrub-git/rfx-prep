## 1. Understanding Sydney Metro's Vision and Needs

Sydney Metro is not simply seeking a technology upgrade—you are building the digital infrastructure for Australia's fastest-growing public transport network. Through our analysis of your requirements and engagement with stakeholders, we have identified your core objectives:

### Digital Accessibility Leadership
Sydney Metro's commitment to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and inclusive design reflects your dedication to serving all members of the community. You require a solution where accessibility is architected into the foundation, not retrofitted as an afterthought.

### Operational Excellence at Scale
With 31 stations serving hundreds of thousands of passengers daily, your digital platforms must deliver consistent, reliable content experiences. You need a system that empowers content teams to work efficiently while maintaining governance and quality standards.

### Security and Compliance
As critical infrastructure, Sydney Metro's digital assets require enterprise-grade security, robust disaster recovery, and compliance with stringent government standards. Your CMS must meet NSW Government security frameworks while providing resilience and continuity.

### Future-Ready Architecture
Your digital ecosystem will continue to evolve—new mobile applications, passenger information systems, IoT integrations, and emerging channels. You need a flexible, API-first platform that adapts to change without requiring complete rebuilds.

### Sustainable Partnership
This is not a project with an end date but the beginning of a long-term digital partnership. You seek a trusted advisor who will invest in your success, transfer knowledge to your team, and provide ongoing support as your needs evolve.

**HCL Technologies has designed our solution with these objectives at the forefront.**
