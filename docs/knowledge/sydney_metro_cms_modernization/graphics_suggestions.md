- Target Architecture diagram (request/response paths, auth, data stores)
- Migration flow (extract, transform, load, validate, redirect map)
- Editorial workflow (draft, review, approve, publish)
- DR timeline (backup frequency, restore steps, RTO/RPO)
- Performance model (CDN cache, API latency budget)
