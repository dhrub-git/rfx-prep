### Reference Quality Assessment

Evaluate each potential reference:

| Reference | Project | Relationship | Enthusiasm | Relevance | Availability | Overall Quality |
|-----------|---------|--------------|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| John Smith | Project A | Excellent | High | 9/10 | High | Excellent |
| Jane Doe | Project B | Very Good | Medium | 8/10 | Medium | Very Good |
| Bob Johnson | Project C | Good | Low | 7/10 | Low | Fair |

**Only use "Excellent" and "Very Good" references**
- Never dilute strong references with weak ones
- Quality over quantity
- 3 excellent references > 5 mediocre references

### Managing Reference Fatigue

**Strategies:**
- Rotate references across opportunities
- Build deep bench of references (10+ available)
- Track how many times each reference is used
- Give references breaks between requests
- Develop multiple references from same client
- Leverage written testimonials to reduce call requests
- Only use for qualified opportunities

**Reference Usage Tracking:**

| Reference Name | Project | Times Used | Last Used | Next Available | Notes |
|----------------|---------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| John Smith | Project A | 3 | 02/2025 | 05/2025 | Excellent but requested break |
| Jane Doe | Project B | 1 | 11/2024 | Available | Enthusiastic, use for high-priority |
| Bob Johnson | Project C | 5 | 03/2025 | 06/2025 | Taking 3-month break |
