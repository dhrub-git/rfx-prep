## Evaluation Perspective

### How Evaluators Score Proposals

**Understanding the Evaluation:**
- Evaluators use weighted scoring methodology
- Each criterion assigned point value and weight
- Proposals scored independently by multiple evaluators
- Consensus discussion to reach final scores
- Technical and cost often evaluated separately

**Common Scoring Scale:**
- 5 = Significantly exceeds requirements
- 4 = Exceeds requirements
- 3 = Meets requirements
- 2 = Partially meets requirements
- 1 = Does not meet requirements

**Weighted Example:**
```
Criterion                  Weight    Score    Weighted Score
Technical Approach         40%       4.5      1.80
Past Performance          25%       4.0      1.00
Team Qualifications       20%       4.2      0.84
Management Approach       15%       3.8      0.57
                         -----              -----
Total Technical Score    100%               4.21

Cost Score                                  4.0

Best Value Score: (Technical × 70%) + (Cost × 30%)
                = (4.21 × 0.70) + (4.0 × 0.30)
                = 2.95 + 1.20 = 4.15
```
